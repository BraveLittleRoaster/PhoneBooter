Absolutely hilariously fun tool I wrote a while back that would flood a phone number of your choice with a hundreds of calls PER SECOND from spoofed numbers.
If they answered it would play a pre-recorded message of your choosing. If they didn't, the prerecorded message would loop in their phone's voicemail box until it was full.
It could also spam thousands of SMS based insults in just a few minutes. 

They stopped calling me about my car warranty after they got doxxed. 🔥🏴‍🔥
